Fanstatic, aren't they?   
Screenshot designs are created by me. Thanks to [Gravit Designer](https://www.designer.io)

In this Game, there is one player mode as well to get you covered if you are alone.  
But Believe me, it's harder than you think, because your opponent is not a computer, that's me!  
And I can prove that, download the app now [from Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coolgame.zlytherin.game.tic_tac_toe).
